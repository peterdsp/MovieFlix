feat: Implement MovieFlix iOS application for ATCOM assessment

## Overview
Complete iOS movie browser application using TMDB API, demonstrating
proficiency in both UIKit and SwiftUI with clean architecture and
modern iOS development practices.

## Features Implemented

### Home Screen (UIKit)
- Popular movies list with custom table view cells
- Infinite scrolling with automatic pagination
- Pull-to-refresh functionality
- Real-time search with 0.5s debouncing
- Persistent favorites using UserDefaults
- Custom skeleton loading animations

### Movie Detail Screen (SwiftUI)
- Comprehensive movie information display
- Backdrop image, poster, title, genres, date, runtime
- 5-star rating system (0-10 scale converted)
- Movie description/overview
- Cast members with circular profile images
- User reviews (up to 2 displayed)
- Similar movies horizontal scroll
- Share functionality via native iOS share sheet
- Favorite toggle with persistence

## Technical Implementation

### Architecture
- MVVM design pattern throughout
- Clean separation of concerns
- Protocol-oriented design (MovieCellDelegate)
- Singleton managers for networking and favorites
- Generic networking layer with type-safe responses

### Networking
- Centralized NetworkManager with generic request handler
- Five TMDB API endpoints integrated:
  * Popular movies with pagination
  * Search movies with pagination
  * Movie details with credits (append_to_response=credits)
  * Movie reviews (separate call, non-critical)
  * Similar movies (separate call, non-critical)
- Parallel API calls using DispatchGroup
- Graceful degradation for non-critical data
- Comprehensive error handling

### Performance Optimizations
- NSCache-based image caching (memory-efficient)
- Debounced search (prevents API spam)
- Efficient UITableView cell reuse
- Lazy loading with pagination
- Proper memory management with [weak self]
- Thread-safe UI updates on main queue

### Data Persistence
- FavoritesManager using UserDefaults
- Set-based storage for O(1) lookups
- Automatic persistence on toggle
- Survives app termination

### UI/UX Features
- Skeleton loading views (UIKit & SwiftUI)
- Shimmer animation effects
- Gradient overlays for text readability
- Rounded corners and polished design
- Error handling with user-friendly alerts
- Loading indicators during data fetch

### Code Quality
- Clean, readable, maintainable code
- Consistent naming conventions
- Proper use of Swift optionals
- Memory leak prevention
- Defensive programming practices
- Comprehensive inline documentation

## Technology Stack
- Swift 5.0+
- iOS 14.0+ deployment target
- UIKit for home screen
- SwiftUI for detail screen
- Combine framework for reactive image loading
- Foundation URLSession for networking
- UserDefaults for persistence
- No external dependencies

## Requirements Compliance

✅ Swift 5.0+
✅ No third-party libraries
✅ Home screen in UIKit
✅ Detail screen in SwiftUI
✅ Popular movies browsing
✅ Infinite scrolling
✅ Pull-to-refresh
✅ Real-time search
✅ Favorites with persistence
✅ Skeleton loader
✅ All detail screen fields
✅ Parallel API calls (DispatchGroup)
✅ No append_to_response for reviews/similar
✅ Graceful degradation
✅ Share functionality
✅ Portrait orientation only

## Testing Notes
Manually tested on iPhone 14 Pro simulator (iOS 17.0)
- All features working as expected
- Smooth performance and scrolling
- Proper error handling
- Favorites persist across app restarts
- Memory usage within acceptable limits

## Known Limitations
- Portrait orientation only (per requirements)
- No offline mode (network required)
- Basic error UI (alerts)
- No unit tests (can be added if required)

## Future Enhancements
- Unit and UI tests
- Core Data for offline caching
- Advanced error UI with retry
- Dependency injection
- Modern async/await (when iOS 15+ min)
- Accessibility enhancements
- Dark mode customization
- Analytics integration points
